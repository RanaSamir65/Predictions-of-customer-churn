# Predictions-of-customer-churn
A lot of customers are leaving their cried card services and the manger of the bank want to investigate the reasons behind their churn. The manger wants to predict which customers, from the currently existing, have a higher probability of being churned, so the decision makers can proactively make more programs, offers, and initiatives to change customers experiences and develop loyalty programs and retention campaigns so they donâ€™t leave, and maybe this would result a come back from attrited customers. 
The data set used from the bank was collected in a wide timeline to collect all customers data and whether they are existing or attritted customers. Our goal here is to model the probability of churn, conditioned on the customer features.
